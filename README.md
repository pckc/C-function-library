# Libft

## Description
The first project required at the **42 School - São Paulo** curriculum.

The goal is to re-write popular **C** functions from scratch and build our very own library. Check the [Subject here](https://github.com/pckc/libft/blob/master/libft.en.subject.pdf)

## What is **42 São Paulo**?
42 is a Software Engineering school with a very human and collaborative approach. There are no teachers. Students receive challenging projects from the school but must pursue knowledge among themselves. Sharing, teaching and collaborating are key.

## How to use
Open the terminal on the directory where this repository was cloned and use the following commands:

- To compile, index and create the library (_.a_ file)
```bash
make
```
- Erase objetcs (_.o_)
```bash
make clean
```
Other commands may be found inside the Makefile.

## Content of the library
*_Every function is preceeded by the suffix ft__ _as per requested_

*_The bonus part refers to linked list manipulation_
